The point of this project was to get acquainted with spark.  I have a year of experience writing sql queries, so once I realized how spark worked I had confidence that I can perform a spark job with a minimal learning curve.  Credit for the code goes to https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/apache-spark-tutorial-machine-learning, the only thing I did different was get it running on Google Cloud.  

The final code for this project is firstpysparkprojectfinal.ipynb
